# cursor-rules-to-claude

This project takes cursor rules from .cursor/rules/*.mdc and builds a CLAUDE.md file. 

## Why is this useful?

Many dev teams use Cursor IDE and build up a large collection of Cursor rules about their codebase. However, Claude Code uses CLAUDE.md files not Cursor rules natively. 

The killer usecase of this package is to enable using Cursor rules with Claude Code directly inside GitHub. This allows for next level vibe coding with adequate context.

## How does it work?

This is a cli program build with Bun (typescript) and using Commander. It will be build distributed as a npm package and a github action with `action.yml` in this codebase.

`npx cursor-rules-to-claude`

By default it generates a context file from the Cursor rules and appends them to the bottom of an already existing CLAUDE.md. If the CLAUDE.md file doesnt exist it creates it.

Cursor rules have a header eg:

```
---
description: Use Bun instead of Node.js, npm, pnpm, or vite.
globs: *.ts, *.tsx, *.html, *.css, *.js, *.jsx, package.json
alwaysApply: false
---
```

If alwaysApply is true then we should copy the contents of the rule file to CLAUDE.md. Append to the bottom. 
If alwaysApply is false then we should add a nicely formatted line directing the agent to open the rules file to know something about title:description. 

### Customisability

We should expect a few flags:

--overwrite - overwrite CLAUDE.md with the new file generated from the Cursor rules rather than appending to the bottom. Default: false
